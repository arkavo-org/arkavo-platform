# Org-Backend
## Intro
This bit of Go code is some interfacing "middleware" between Arkavo-AI web app and the Keycloak/OpenTDF security platform. It serves as an abstraction layer which superimposes User-origin organizational needs over the hard reality of Identity Access Management (IAM). These include permissions, messaging, and events. Furthermore, organizational paradigms can be arbitrarily implemented.
